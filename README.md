## Why PHP?

Besides the fact that it is my programming language of choice, there are two reasons to start with PHP.

### PHP is widely used

PHP is likely the most widely used server-side programming language (see this article, for example). It’s used on millions of servers world wide.

PHP is very popular in the open source world, where applications like WordPress and Drupal live. One reason is that PHP is itself open source.

This means that your PHP skills will have value to many different people (including you!).

### PHP is (relatively) easy to learn

Make no mistake: programming is hard. For most people, anyway.

What people have trouble with is not the programming languages, but the way of thinking about program design. This only comes with practice, practice, and more practice.

But still, some languages are easier to learn than others. Java is one of the more difficult. It’s a good language, but it’s very structured, and hard for beginners to get started with.

Two of the easiest languages to learn are JavaScript and PHP. Even a few lines of JavaScript and PHP can do useful things. You can start writing programs quickly, without having to learn of lot of stuff first.
